Thanks for downloading my plugin :]

The Souperior Modification nodes are NOT enabled by default.

Soupy nodes automatically assign a skeleton to themselves 
if there is one above them in the tree.
Alternatively, you can assign the skeleton node yourself.
I personally recommend grouping the modification nodes 
as close to the skeleton in the hierarchy as possible.
Skeletons are, alas, still a bit buggy, and weird edgecases arise when shifting nodes around.
If something seems to be broken, try reloading your project.
Skeletons are weird like that.

Soupy Nodes are entirely separate from the inbuilt skeleton modifications, 
and applying both at the same time to one bone may be a bad idea.

The system also relies on bone angle and length, so make sure to
disable "auto calculate" on bones that dont have any further child bones.

Additionally, I have provided a demo scene 
that can help you get a grasp on the intended usage of the addon.


I am not sure if I will be adding more to this plugin in the future.
In the meantime, check out "Wiggly Appendage 2D" by Tameno-01 for jiggle bone implementation.

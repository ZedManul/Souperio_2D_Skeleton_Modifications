Thanks for downloading my plugin :]

Current soupy modifications:
	LookAt
	StayAt
	TwoBoneIK
	JiggleBones
	Angle and Position Constraints

Planned soupy modifications:
	FABRIK

I did my best to write up comments and clean up the code.
You should be able to gather most of the needed info 
about the usage of various nodes by simply pressing f1, typing "Soup"
and opening the autogenerated documentation for the node.

Additionally, I have provided a demo scene  that can help you get a grasp on the intended usage of the addon.
Its a bit clunky and outdated, so expect a new one soon.


Skeletons are, alas, still a bit buggy, and weird edgecases arise when shifting nodes around.
If something seems to be broken, try reloading your project.
Skeletons are weird like that.

There is now support for custom easing motion on all modifications!
I am quite happy with how the system turned out, 
and I will likely make it a separate plugin later on.

Soupy Nodes are entirely separate from the inbuilt skeleton modifications, 
and applying both at the same time to one bone may be a bad idea.

The system also relies on bone angle and length, so make sure to
disable "auto calculate" on bones that dont have any further child bones.
